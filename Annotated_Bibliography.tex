\begin{description}
	\item[Aim:]
	To investigate generalized Ramsey theory, which extends on classical Ramsey theory.
	Find important ideas found in Ramsey theory for graphs while also focusing on Ramsey numbers.

\item[Style:]
Review Paper
\item[Cross References:]
Ramsey theory only considers complete graphs. 
A proposed way of solving such problems is to solve many exponential NP-complete problems.
Some mathematical proofs are explored.
The article \cite{PhysRevA.93.032301} tries getting around this by using Quantum Computing to find these numbers.
\item [Summary:]
Ramsey theory tries to understand the patterns that occur within graphs.
It deals with relationship between graphs and classes of graphs.
Finding Ramsey numbers is difficult.
They can be defined as part of NP-complete problem or even harder.
Which are a class of difficult problems.
Generalized Ramsey Theory does not only consider complete graphs.
We have Ramsey numbers involving a fixed graph with increasing n, try to find exact results for all n. 
Then an asymptotic formula at the bounds is used to give information about these numbers.

\begin{description}
	\item[Aim:] 
	To prove that the upper bound of $R(5,5)$ is $46$
	
	\item [Style:] 
	Review paper
	
	\item [Cross References:] 
	Building on prior work, particularly the 2018 result by that found to be $ R(5,5) \leq 48$.
	With \cite{Exoo1993} the bounds of $R(5,5)$ were then decreased to 43 and 46.
	Compared to the analytical methods used to find $R(4,4)=18$\cite{GreenwoodGleason1955} uses computational approaches like linear programming for this bound.
	Due to computational complexity of Ramsey numbers \cite{burr1981generalized}.
	
	
	\item[Summary:] 
	The upper bound of $R(5,5)$ is found to be 46, improving it from 48.
	Linear programming is used to reduce the number of graphs needed to be considered.
	Known Ramsey numbers $R(4,5)$ and $R(4,4)$ are used to help in defining this bound.
	We see why computational techniques are required for finding these numbers.

\cite{Deutsch1989}~\bibentry{Deutsch1989}
\begin{description}
	\item [ Aim:]
	To understand the theory of quantum computations using understanding of classical ones.
	By using the ideas of classical gates and extending them to quantum gates.
	\item[Style:]
	Journal article, theoretical.
	
	\item[Cross References:]
	Deutsch builds on universal quantum computer by \cite{deutsch1985quantum} from classical computing to quantum mechanics. 
	We understand about the development of quantum computation theory.
	He then relates universal quantum computer to the classical computer using the paper \cite{Turing1936}.
	While showing quantum computer can perform powerful computations using superposition and entanglement.
	\item [Summary:]
	Computation can be thought as a mathematical function that has an input, and gets an output from that.
	Theory of computations deals with the complexity of a problem.
	Quantum computations could be represented as networks of quantum gates.
	The outputs of quantum gates is always a superposition states of the output basis states.
	A universal quantum gate simplifies quantum computing theory.
	It makes building quantum computers more practical. 
	Quantum coherence gives them computational power over classical ones.

\cite{PhysRevA.93.032301}~\bibentry{PhysRevA.93.032301}
\begin{description}
	\item [Aim:]
	To find Ramsey numbers using quantum computer algorithms.
	\item [Style:]
	Theoretical Research paper
	\item [Cross References:]
	Quantum algorithm is used to calculate Ramsey Numbers, proposed in \cite{gaitan2012ramsey}.
	A Hamiltonian is used, this was also referenced in the paper \cite{doi:10.1137/S0097539796298637}.
	Wang turned the problem into a combinatorial optimization problem.
	Adiabatic Quantum Optimization considering \cite{farhi2000quantum} was used.
	
	\item [Summary:]
	Ramsey numbers are very difficult to calculate.
	Quantum computers provide a computational speedup compared to classical ones.
	A Hamiltonian of the problem gets defined.
	If ground-state energy($E_1$) of a Hamiltonian is zero a Ramsey number exist. 
	And using bounds of Ramsey Number n is increased until the Hamiltonian $E_1$ is larger than 0.
	The qubit measures Hamiltonian energy spectrum by varying reference state energy. 
	And when the n is not a Ramsey Number the qubits exhibits a resonance dynamics.
	This means they will oscillate at a larger frequency.

	\item[Summary:]
	 In theory quantum computers can solve certain computational problems fast.
	They use interference to increase or decrease the probability of a given state.
	There is a quantum algorithm that can distinguish between two classes of polynomial-time computable functions in polynomial time. 
	This suggests a quantum advantage in function classification.
